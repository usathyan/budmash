# Privacy Policy for BudMash

**Last updated:** January 11, 2026

## Overview

BudMash is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your personal data stays on your device.

## Data We Collect

### Data Stored Locally (On Your Device Only)
- **Favorite strains** you add to your profile
- **Terpene profile** calculated from your favorites
- **OpenRouter API key** you provide for AI features
- **Cached strain data** for offline use

This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to us.

### Data Sent to Third Parties

When you use AI features (menu scanning, strain analysis), your requests are sent to:

- **OpenRouter.ai** - Routes requests to AI models (Claude, Gemini)
  - Menu images (for scanning)
  - Strain names (for terpene lookup)
  - See [OpenRouter's Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy)

We do not operate servers or collect any of this data ourselves.

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Personal information (name, email, location)
- Usage analytics or telemetry
- Device identifiers
- Browsing history

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- **Delete your data** by uninstalling the app or clearing app data
- **Export your data** is not currently supported but planned

## Children's Privacy

BudMash is intended for adults of legal age in jurisdictions where cannabis is legal. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Changes to This Policy

Updates will be posted at this URL. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance.

**Summary:** Your strain preferences stay on your phone. AI requests go to OpenRouter. We don't collect anything.
