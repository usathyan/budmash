## What It Does

You walk into a dispensary. The menu has 50+ strains. **Which one matches what you like?**

BudMash decodes the molecular fingerprint of strains you love, then scans any dispensary menu to find strains with matching terpene profiles. Strains are ranked with clear badges — **Great**, **Good**, **Fair**, or **Low** — so you know at a glance what to try.

**Stop guessing. Start matching.**

---

## How It Works

1. **Build Your Profile** — Go to the Profile tab, tap "+ Add", and pick 3-5 strains you've enjoyed. BudMash builds your terpene fingerprint automatically.

2. **Find Your Match** — From the Home screen, tap **Near Me** to browse nearby dispensaries, **Scan Menu** to photograph a menu board, **From Gallery** to pick a screenshot, or **Search by Name** to look up strains directly.

3. **Get Match Scores** — Every strain is ranked with simple badges: **Great** (80%+), **Good** (60-79%), **Fair** (40-59%), or **Low** (<40%). Toggle Advanced Mode in About for detailed scores and algorithm breakdowns.
