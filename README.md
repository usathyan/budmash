## What It Does

You walk into a dispensary. The menu has 50+ strains. **Which one matches what you like?**

BudMash decodes the molecular fingerprint of strains you love, then scans any dispensary menu to find strains with matching terpene profiles. A 93% match means the chemistry aligns with what you've enjoyed before.

**Stop guessing. Start matching.**

---

## How It Works

1. **Build Your Profile** — Like strains you enjoy. BudMash extracts each strain's terpene profile and builds your ideal chemical signature.

2. **Scan Any Menu** — Screenshot your dispensary's flower menu. AI vision extracts strain names, then fetches terpene data from a database of 2,367 strains.

3. **Get Match Scores** — Every strain is scored against your profile using cosine similarity, euclidean distance, and pearson correlation.
